> **Note:** We will declare some points for attention in the mails. Following will be included:
>
> 1. How to login to a start platform.
> 2. The latest details of the schedule of interop day. (If some details are changed for some reasons.
> 3. What should be prepared by local and remote participants before the interop day?

## Preparation

Every participant who will attend the interop day (locally and remotely) should make some preparation ahead of time: 

1. Please make sure you can connect to the IRC channel before the interop day.
2. Every local participant, please take a laptop by yourself.
3. Every server participant should deploy his test server with a public ip. It's necessary for test.
4. Please download the test template before interop. (Download from here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1irUuS40aydX5hxQIexz1PTIcnYOJRBj_OYB2lXa3vd8/edit?usp=sharing )

## Step 1. Start

1. Setup an IRC channel (#alto-interop@freenode is all right) before the interop day.

2. Participants enter into the IRC channel. Chairs confirm everyone is ready. And then, every participant will be allocted an Test ID (Server A, B, C ... Client A, B ...) from chairs.

3. Every server participant posts a public url in the IRC channel. 

## Step 2. Test

### Step 2.1 Declare Implementation

Every client participant shows how many features will be tested. And every server participant shows how many features have been implemented, and could be tested. (refer to the test template.)

### Step 2.2 Test Loop

1. Every time, one client just choose one server to test.
2. Each of the clients choose different servers to test firstly.
3. Once a client finishes its tests from a server, the volunteer post a message in IRC channel. And then, the client participant could choose another server which is free to continue testing.
4. Client participants need to fill out the test report template for each test. (Volunteers could help to do this.) The template could be downloaded from following url:

    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1irUuS40aydX5hxQIexz1PTIcnYOJRBj_OYB2lXa3vd8/edit?usp=sharing

## Step 3. Evaluate

After all tests finished, client participants send test reports to our volunteers.

Wait for a moment...

Our volunteers will deal with these reports, and make a comparison among all (client, server) peers. The final report will be presented at following url:

## Step 4. Summary and Report

We will post a comprehensive report on the web. And we will inform you of the url and some extra resources by email in a few days.
